# Learn Javascript for Web Development

If you are already good with fundamentals as well as ES6/7 syntax, you can go ahead and learn some front-end frameworks and tooling.

## What you'll know at the end?

Here are some questions you should be able to answer

- Why Javascript? what is it good for? how is it different than other programming language?
- what’s the programming paradigm for JS?
- data types: primitive, object
- equality vs strict equality
- what hoisting is
- the implication of using various variable declaration var, const, let.
- the difference between function declaration and expression and the implication of each.
- anonymous functions and immediately invoked function expressions (iffe)
- function vs block scoping
- lexical binding vs dynamic binding
- how to write callback code, translate them into Promise syntax, as well as async/await.
- for-in, for’-int’, for-of, forEach, map (loops and iterators)
- object and array pattern matching (deconstructing)
- spread vs rest operators
- use default values in function parameters
- template literals (string)
- what are all the falsy and truthy values in JS

## Learning Environment
I recommend using a Node.js environment to learn before using the browser. When using browser, some newer JS syntax will require the use of a transpiler like Babel or https://babeljs.io/repl/

Always use the latest version of node. You can manage multiple node versions on your computer with `NVM`
